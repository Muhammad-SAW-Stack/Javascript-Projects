//To assign a veriable in Javascript we write:
var X = "Hello, world!"
//We assigned variable X to string value 
//“Hello, world!” The syntax for assigning 
//variables in JavaScript is var _ =.
//If we then wanted to display the string 
//“Hello, world!” using our variable we would 
//write:
document.write(X)
