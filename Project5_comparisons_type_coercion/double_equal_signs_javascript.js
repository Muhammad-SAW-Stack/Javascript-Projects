/* == is used to show that a comparison should be made. Specifically, 
 * the "==" symbol is an instruction to check whether the data on the 
 * left side of the symbol is equal to the data on the right side. 
 * The answer to this comparison is an answer of "true" or "false."*/

/*When the "==" symbol is used to check for equality, usually it is 
used like this:*/

/*[first item to be compared] == [second item to be compared]*/

/* Example*/
(10 + 5) == 15

/*In this example, we are asking the computer to check whether 
the result of adding 5 and 10 is equal to 15. Here, the response 
would be "true" since (10 + 5) is equal to 15.*/

/*In JavaScript, to obtain the output “true”, we’d write:*/
document.write(10 == 10);


/*For “false”, we’d write:*/
document.write(3 == 11);
